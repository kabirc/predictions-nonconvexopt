# Predictions for iterative nonconvex optimization with random data
Python implementation of the numerical examples included in the paper [Sharp global convergence guarantees for iterative nonconvex optimization: A Gaussian process perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09859) by [Kabir Aladin Chandrasekher](https://web.stanford.edu/~kabirc/), [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/), and [Christos Thrampoulidis](https://sites.google.com/view/cthrampo/home).  

---
The file gordon_update.py contains implementations of the Gordon predictions and the file empirical_updates.py contains implementations of the synthetic data generation as well as the various algorithms used.  

The plots in the introduction are generated in the file 'Introduction Plots.ipynb', and the various numerical examples (contained in Section 5) are generated by the remaining .ipynb files.
